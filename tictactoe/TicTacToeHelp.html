</h2>

<p>It is well-known that Tic-Tac-Toe is a "solved" game and two knowledgable players will always play to a
draw.  The game is provided here more as a sample of what can be quickly developed using the <b>unigame</b>
framework.</p>

<p>In this version of Tic-Tac-Toe, you play by touching one of the squares that is not yet occupied.  The
player listed first (the player who was "leader" during game initiation) always plays first and is assigned
the <b>X</b> symbol.  The other player is assigned the <b>O</b> symbol.  Play passes automatically back
and forth until the game is drawn or someone wins.</b>

<p>Winning is indicated when a player's box turns gold and the icon changes to a gold star.</p>
